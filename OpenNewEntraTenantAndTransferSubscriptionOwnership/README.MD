1. signup on https://outlook.com and create a NEW account that has **as less chars as possible (!)**
1. after signing up, go to https://signup.azure.com using the new account to create a new Entra tenant (choose PAY AS YOU GO and enter credit cart, don't worry it's not gonna be used)
1. Follow the [video quick guide](openNewTenant.zip) to allow access to the 150$ azure subscription from your new tenant (PM me for the password)
