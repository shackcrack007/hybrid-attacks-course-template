# Create an Azure VM with a new AD domain

This template will deploy a lab for the course: a new VM (along with a new VNet ) and will configure it as a Domain Controller and create a new forest and domain + win11 vm

As part of the lab setup, you will:
* Create an Entra tenant - which will play the "cloud" role
* Deploy Azure template to your subscription account, this will only be used to host the "On-premise" Active Directory VMs
* Install and confiugre Entra (AD) Connect

### AD Creds:
```
* domain: YOURDOMAIN.onmicrosoft.com
* user: rootuser
* password: CHOSEN AT DEPLOYMENT TIME, follow instructions
```

# Instructions 
* Use only your personal Microsoft account, unless instructed otherwise

### 1. Entra Tenant + Azure Prep
1. **Azure subscription**: [activate your free 150$ Azure credits](https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits) (put in your personal Microsoft account), this will be used to deploy the Azure template and host the VMs

2. **Entra tenant**: 
    1. create a new admin user for the Entra tenant: login to [Entra portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_UsersAndTenants/UserManagementMenuBlade/~/AllUsers/menuId/), and create a new user: ![createuser](pics/create_tenant_admin_user.png)

    2. under *Assignments* > add *Hybrid Identity Administrator* and *Global Administrator* and save: 
    ![roles](pics/role_assignment.png) 

    3. verify by signing in using the new account and finishing MFA setup: ![signin](pics/signin.png)

    4. keep these creds, *we'll refer to them as **"ENTRA CREDS"***

3. **Enable Azure subscription management** using your **new Entra admin account**: 
    1. sign into [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Properties) (if link doesn't work, look inside for "Entra") and turn on the following toggle: 
        ![manage_enable](pics/manage_tenant.png) 

    2. Refresh browser, search and select your subscription > *IAM > Add role assignment*:
    ![addrole](pics/add_ga_azure.png)
    *Privileged administrator roles > Owner*:
    ![owner](pics/owner.png)
    Next, select your new Entra admin user:
    ![user](pics/user_selected.png)
    
    Next, select *Allow user to assign all roles (highly privileged)*

    Then, Click *Review and assign* and finish the process.

### 2. Deploy Azure VMs - "On premise" Active Directory VMs
This part will deploy and configure an active directory domain with two VMs: a Domain Controller ("dcVm") and Win11 VM
1. Using your new Entra tenant's admin account: 
    [![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fshackcrack007%2Fhybrid-attacks-course-template%2Fmain%2Fmain.json)
    * create a resource group where all the lab resources will be created (you may use Israel Central, if something fails switch to US East 2) 
    * if fails, you might need to re-register a provider: Search for your subscription > **Resource providers** > look for **Microsoft.Network** and seelct **Re-register**: ![register](pics/register_provider.png)
    * if it fails, try Copilot error diagnose inside Azure, it's usually very helpful
3. keep the password- *we'll refer to it as **"AD CREDS"***:
![deployment](pics/deployment.png)
##
### 3. Prepare VMs
Once deployment is finished, do the following for **each VM**, starting with the DC VM:
1. RDP using '***rootuser***' and your chosen password 
2. **disable both the Defender runtime protection and cloud delivered protection** (under *Virus and threat protection > Manage settings*)
![defender](pics/defender.jpg)
3. Open Powershell **as administrator** and run the script, modify *CHANGEME* to your chosen password:
```powershell 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shackcrack007/hybrid-attacks-course-template/main/prepareVM.ps1" -OutFile "C:\\prepareVM.ps1"; `
& "C:\\prepareVM.ps1" `
-DomainUser rootuser `
-DomainPassword CHANGEME `
-DomainName YOURDOMAIN.onmicrosoft.com
```
* ignore the errors
* check for a text file on your desktop, if doesn't exists, run the script again
    * make sure it exists on both VMs
* when done, turn off the VMs, see you when the course starts!
